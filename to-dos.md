## To-dos

1. **Webscrape** episode transcripts from [The Adventure Zone Wiki](http://theadventurezone.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Balance_Arc_Transcript)
2. **Preprocess** text data: clean and format (TBD)
3. Write **regex** to find Travis's D20 rolls.
4. Compile dice rolls into a table, subtracting modifiers if applicable, and **plot the distribution in a histogram**
5. Using a **statistical hypothesis test**, determine the likelihood that Travis's D20 rolls would have occurred if he were using a fair D20 (i.e. if his rolls were sampled uniformly at random from the numbers 1-20)
